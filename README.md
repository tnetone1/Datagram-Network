### 2. Upload to Your VPS (optional)

If you're starting from your local system and want to move the binary to your VPS:

scp ~/Downloads/datagram-cli-x86_64-linux username@your_server_ip:/root/
Or, if you've stored the binary in this GitHub repo, you can download it directly:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tnetone1/Datagram-Network/main/datagram-cli-x86_64-linux
chmod +x datagram-cli-x86_64-linux

---

### 3. Make the Binary Executable
SSH into your VPS and set execute permission:


chmod +x datagram-cli-x86_64-linux

---


### 4. Get Your License Key
Go to your Datagram Wallet Licenses.

Copy your license key from the Licenses tab.

---

### 5. Run the Node
Start the node using your license key:


./datagram-cli-x86_64-linux run --key YOUR-LICENSE-KEY
Replace YOUR-LICENSE-KEY with the one you got from your dashboard.

### 6. Verify Node Status
After running, go to your dashboard â€” your node should show as "Connected".

As long as it remains online, youâ€™ll earn 250 points every 6 hours.
